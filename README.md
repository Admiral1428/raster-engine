# raster-engine
A 3D graphics engine built from scratch using C++, employing software rasterization for rendering.

The purpose of this project was to improve my C++ skills and to gain a fundamental understanding of 3D graphics principles. The [SDL3 library](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases) is used to achieve basic window creation and pixel manipulation.
